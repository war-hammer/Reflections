Question 1.
When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?

If I am working on another computer than my own, or if other people are contributing to a file.

Question 2.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?

My remote respository may branch in a direction that is no longer my master branch
on my local Git repository.
