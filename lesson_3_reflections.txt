Question 1.
When would you want to use a remote repository rather 
than keeping all your work local?

If I am working on another computer than my own, 
or if other people are contributing to a file.

Question 2.
Why might you want to always pull changes manually
rather than having Git automatically stay
up-to-date with your remote repository?

My remote repository may branch in a
direction that is no longer my master branch
on my local Git repository.

Question 3.
Describe the differences between forks, clones,
and branches. When would you use one instead of another?

The difference between forks, clones  and branches are the 
location where they are used either local or remote and the tracing of its meta
data,
forking on GitHub allows anyone to clone remotely to their account and anyone else to find who wrote the
original code before it was forked aptly named origin, 
and prevents access to modifying the origin without
permission. 
Cloning is copying an exact version of the source either from
a remote repository on GitHub or a local repository.
Branching allows a branch to continue along the master or
create a new branch which will not affect the master branch 
unless the master is chosen to merge.
